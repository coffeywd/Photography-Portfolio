# Photography-Portfolio
I'm using this project to develop an online portfolio of my photos.  I started taking pictures during my high school summer vacations while visting family in England.  After I received a 35mm SLR for Christmas one year it turned into a hobby.

I took my first roll of film during my summer vacations in London.  Whenever I had a free moment I grabbed my camera, and jetted for the closest tube station.  London's such a great city to explore because you can't throw a rock without hitting an underground stop.

Liverpool St. served as the first location for my photos.  The buildings blend the ancient with the modern.  Bau hause office buildings stand atop Roman foundations with the excavated ruins exposed for all eyes to see and marvel.  Amongst the ruins minimalist sculptures dot the concrete landscape with a splayed out fountain serving as the keystone.
